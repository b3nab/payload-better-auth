# Two-Factor Authentication

The plugin provides built-in support for Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) two-factor authentication in your Payload CMS admin panel.

## Disabling 2FA

2FA plugin is enabled by default to provide this feature to your Payload CMS admin panel.
If you want to disable it you can change in your plugin configuration:

```ts
betterAuthPlugin({
  betterAuthPlugins: {
    twoFactor: false,
  }
})
```

## Admin Panel Integration

The plugin automatically adds two new admin views:
- `/admin/two-factor-setup` - For setting up 2FA
- `/admin/two-factor-verify` - For verifying 2FA codes

## Custom Components

The plugin provides these components for the admin panel:
- `SetupTwoFactorServer`
- `VerifyTwoFactorServer`

## API Endpoints

The plugin exposes the following 2FA-related endpoints:

```ts
// Setup 2FA
POST /api/auth/two-factor/setup
{
  "userId": string
}

// Verify 2FA code
POST /api/auth/two-factor/verify
{
  "code": string,
  "userId": string
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. 2FA is only available for admin users
2. Each user can only have one 2FA device registered
3. Backup codes are automatically generated during setup
4. The secret is encrypted before storage
