# createAuthLayer üõ†Ô∏è

The `createAuthLayer` function is the core of Better Auth's Next.js integration. It provides a set of pre-built helpers that make it easy to implement authentication checks and guards in your Next.js actions, routes and components.

## Setup üîß

First, create an auth layer in your Next.js project:


```typescript title="lib/auth.ts"
import { createAuthLayer } from '@payload-better-auth'
import { config } from '@/payload.config'
import { payloadBetterAuthConfig } from '@/payload-better-auth.config.ts'

export const {
  auth,
  isAuth,
  isGuest,
  isUser,
  isAdmin,
  isRole,
  guardAuth
} = createAuthLayer(config, payloadBetterAuthConfig)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Better Auth Integration">
This setup is similar to Better Auth's `lib/auth.ts` file, but with a key difference: you don't need to create a Better Auth instance manually using `betterAuth({...})`. The payload-better-auth plugin automatically creates and manages the Better Auth instance for you. The `createAuthLayer` function simply provides access to this pre-configured instance along with additional helpers.
</Callout>

## Available Helpers üéØ

The `createAuthLayer` function returns several helpers:

## Better Auth Instance
- `auth`: Better Auth Instance

[Learn more on auth instance](../auth-layer/auth-instance)

### Checkers
- `isAuth`: Check if user is authenticated
- `isGuest`: Check if user is a guest (not authenticated)
- `isUser`: Check if user is logged in
- `isAdmin`: Check if user is an admin
- `isRole`: Check if user has specific role

[Learn more on checkers](../auth-layer/checkers)

### Guards
- `guardAuth`: Protect routes and components

[Learn more on guards](../auth-layer/guards)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```ts
// lib/auth.ts
import { createAuthLayer } from '@payload-better-auth/nextjs'
import { config } from '@/payload.config'

export const { auth, isAuth, isGuest, isUser, isAdmin, isRole, guardAuth } = createAuthLayer(
  config,
  {
    betterAuth: {
      session: {
        maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
      },
    },
  }
)
```

### Using in Components

```tsx
// app/protected/page.tsx
import { isAdmin } from '@/lib/auth'

export default async function ProtectedPage() {
  const isAdminUser = await isAdmin()

  if (!isAdminUser) {
    return <div>Access denied</div>
  }

  return <div>Admin content</div>
}
```

## Best Practices üìö

1. Create a single auth layer instance and export it
2. Use guards for route protection
3. Use checkers for conditional rendering
4. Handle errors appropriately
5. Cache authentication state when possible
