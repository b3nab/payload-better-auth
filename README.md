<!-- # Payload Better Auth Plugin -->

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This plugin is currently a WIP and not yet totally ready.
> I mean, I'm using it in production, but it's not yet public available.

A plugin that integrates [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) with [Payload CMS v3](https://payloadcms.com), providing enhanced authentication capabilities.
This plugin is thought to be used in production, with real users, so to be rock solid well tested and reliable. üóø

## Description

The `payload-better-auth` plugin wraps the better-auth library to seamleassly integrate advanced authentication features into Payload CMS v3. It enhanches developer productivity and user experience by offering more sophisticated authentication methods beyond Payload's built-in auth system.
Definitely it's a better-way ü§ì to manage authentication for Payload CMS v3.

### Why This Plugin?

While Payload CMS comes with a solid and extensible authentication system out of the box, it primarily focuses on basic email/password authentication and API keys. This serves many use cases well, but modern applications often require more sophisticated authentication methods and features.

### Features

The goal is to seamlessly integrate better-auth in your Payload CMS v3 application, providing a robust and feature-rich authentication system with a focus on user experience and developer productivity.

- **Basic integration - Out of the box ü§ù**
  - Integration with Better Auth
  - Automatic Collections creation
  - Automatic Better Auth API Endpoints creation
  - Payload Adapter as Better Auth database
- **Better Integration ü§ì**
  - 2FA TOTP-based for Admin Panel
  - Easily extend Collections using Payload-like collection's config

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add payload-better-auth
```

## Quick Start

Into your `payload.config.ts` file, add the plugin:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { betterAuthPlugin } from "payload-better-auth"

export default buildConfig({

  // ... other config

  plugins: [
    betterAuthPlugin({
      // Better Auth Config. https://www.better-auth.com/docs/reference/options
      betterAuth: {
        // used by two factor plugin as an issuer and other things
        appName: "My App",
        // better-auth secret - you can omit it if your env variable is named `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
        /** you can generate a good secret
         * using the following command:
         * @example
         * openssl rand -base64 32
         */
        secret: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
      },
    })
  ],

  // ... other config

})
```

### Roadmap (TODOs)

- [ ] Payload Auth Endpoints - Needs to replace all remaining payload default auth endpoints
- [ ] Auth Strategies - Needs to improve auth strategies for better-auth plugins
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Tests - Needs to add more tests and e2e tests
