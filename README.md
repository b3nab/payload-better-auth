<!-- # Payload Better Auth Plugin -->

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This plugin is currently a WIP and not yet totally ready.

A plugin that integrates [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) with [Payload CMS v3](https://payloadcms.com), providing enhanced authentication capabilities.
This plugin is thought to be used in production, with real users, so to be rock solid well tested and reliable. üóø

## Description

The `payload-better-auth` plugin wraps the better-auth library to seamleassly integrate advanced authentication features into Payload CMS v3. It enhanches developer productivity and user experience by offering more sophisticated authentication methods beyond Payload's built-in auth system.
Definitely it's a better-way ü§ì to manage authentication for Payload CMS v3.

The goal is to seamlessly integrate better-auth in your Payload CMS v3 application, providing a robust and feature-rich authentication system with a focus on user experience and developer productivity.

- **Basic integration - Out of the box ü§ù**
  - Integration with Better Auth
  - Better Auth API Endpoints
  - Payload Adapter as Better Auth database
- **Better Integration ü§ì**
  - 2FA TOTP-based for Admin Panel
  - Automatic Collections creation
  - Extend Collections using Payload-like collection's config

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add payload-better-auth
```

## Quick Start

Into your `payload.config.ts` file, add the plugin:

```ts
import { betterAuthPlugin } from "payload-better-auth";

export default buildConfig({
  // ... other config

  plugins: [
    betterAuthPlugin({
      // Better Auth Config. https://www.better-auth.com/docs/reference/options
      betterAuth: {
        // used by two factor plugin as an issuer and other things
        appName: "My App",
        // better-auth secret - you can omit it if your env variable is named `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
        /** you can generate a good secret
         * using the following command:
         * @example
         * openssl rand -base64 32
         */
        secret: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
      },
      // Plugin options that override the default ones from the plugin
      // betterAuthPlugins: {
      //   twoFactor: true,
      // },
    }),

    // ... other plugins
  ],
});
```

### Why This Plugin?

While Payload CMS comes with a solid and extensible authentication system out of the box, it primarily focuses on basic email/password authentication and API keys. This serves many use cases well, but modern applications often require more sophisticated authentication methods and features.

### Features

Here‚Äôs what the plugin currently offers:

- Seamless Integration with Better Auth: Leverages Better Auth to provide advanced authentication features within your Payload CMS application.

- 2FA TOTP-based for Admin Panel: Enhances security by adding Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) two-factor authentication to the PayloadCMS admin interface.

- Automatic Collection Creation: Simplifies setup by automatically generating the required collections for user management and authentication.

- Customizable Collections: Allows developers to extend default collections with additional fields, tailoring authentication data to specific needs.

- Payload as Database: Ensures data consistency by using Payload CMS as the database adapter for Better Auth.

- Enhanced Auth Endpoints: Provides Better Auth‚Äôs API endpoints for advanced authentication, complementing Payload‚Äôs default auth endpoints.

### Roadmap (TODOs)

- [ ] Payload Collections Auth Endpoints - Needs to replace all remaining payload default auth endpoints
- [ ] Auth Strategies - Needs to add strategies for better-auth plugins
- [ ] Documentation & Testing
  - [ ] Website for docs
  - [ ] Tests - Needs more tests and e2e tests
